  <h3>Join us!</h3>

  <h3>SJSU students:</h3>
  <p>The Arhar Lab welcomes all SJSU students, regardless of their major or
  level of experience. The only requirement for joining the team is one
  semester of general chemistry. If you’re interested in joining our team of
  scientists, please email Dr. Arhar to set up a time to talk.</p>

  <h3>Non-SJSU students:</h3>
  <p>Current Community College students (and BA/BS students from other
  universities) can reach out to Dr. Arhar, as there may be volunteer
  opportunities, especially in the summer. Unfortunately, our lab cannot accept
  high school students.</p>
