  <h3>Join us!</h3>

  <h3>SJSU students:</h3>
  <p>The Arhar Lab welcomes all SJSU students, regardless of their major or
  level of experience. The only requirement for joining the team is one
  semester of general chemistry. If youâ€™re interested in joining our team of
  scientists, please email Dr. Arhar to set up a time to talk.</p>

  <h3>Non-SJSU students:</h3>
  <p>There are currently no postdoctoral positions available and while we accept 
  MS graduate students, there is no PhD program for chemistry at SJSU. We also 
  cannot accept high school students due to the inherent risks of working in a 
  lab. Current Community College students (and BA/BS students from other
  universities) can reach out to Dr. Arhar, as there may be volunteer
  opportunities, especially in the summer.</p>
